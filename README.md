# FCTechTest

This solution includes two projects one is the main project with the class library and the other is testing with xunit framework. 

Dont net version 3.1 is used as its stable and there is long term support available. 

I have created a CheckoutService which has interface ICheckoutService which takes care of two method Scan & Total

I have made use of two class object which is Item and Item offer for any offers available. 

Dictionary or Hasmap is used to store item quantity and also price based on the sku.

All the test cases are in the separate project supported by X unit framework.
